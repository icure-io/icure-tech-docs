# Use the Console

The Console acts complementary to the iCure SDKs. It enables watching the top-level structure of the database, as well as the amount and type of content each [user](../icure-data-stack/icure-data-model/user/ "mention") or [healthcareparty.md](../icure-data-stack/rest-api-calls/healthcareparty.md "mention") has entered. As data is encrypted and the respective private key is required for data decryption, it is impossible to retrieve and usable database entries from the console.&#x20;
