The [iCure Console](https://console.icure.dev) is a graphic interface enabling high level management of your database, such as creating a new Users or Healthcareparty and editing their information.&#x20;

### [mobile-web-sdks](../icure-data-stack/mobile-web-sdks/ "mention")

To access the Database, the use of an SDK is adviced. SDKs handle the encryption/decryption process. so that the user can maintain the encryption perimeter and access the data at the same time.&#x20;

### [rest-api-calls](../icure-data-stack/rest-api-calls/ "mention")

A user may use the REST API well, however the encryption of data will have to be separately managed.
