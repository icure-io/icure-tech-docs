# Access Rights management

iCure implements a multi-tiered access rights scheme to ensure that identifiable data are shared with the respective users, that may be hierarchically or specialty connected.

Allocating fine-grained Access Rights allows compliance with applicable laws and additional privacy policies.  Custom network graphs can be developed, to implement complicated schemes, in which each user has owns a personal unique encryption key.&#x20;
